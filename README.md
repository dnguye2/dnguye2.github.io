# Personal Photography Website


## Purpose

I wanted to learn how to make my own website with full control and also have an online place (other than Instagram) to showcase my architectural, street, and portrait photography and process.



## Plan for Website

Because I wanted it to be minimal and with only the features I needed, I decided to make a static website.
To make the website, I'll be using Jekyll, HTML/CSS, and Javascript.

Using Figma, I drafted what I wanted the website to look like. Below is the homepage:
